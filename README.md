# GraphicalTweaks
Mod for the game FTL: Faster Than Light. Changes floor images and map backgrounds. Latest version: 1.0

The release GraphicalTweaks.zip contains folders "data", "img" and "mod-appendix". Change the file extension from .zip to .ftl to use as a mod with the [Slipstream Mod Manager](https://github.com/Vhati/Slipstream-Mod-Manager), or change the setting to consider .zip files as mods.

<ol>
    <li>Map Background tweak: visual clarity is a problem when beacons appear over bright regions of the default backgrounds, or when Mike Hopley's Enhanced Fleet Pursuit mod shows dark lines over dark regions. This mod replaces the 3 backgrounds with a solid dark grey to solve this.</li>
    <li>Floor Image tweak: all vanilla ships now use a more consistent floor image, revealing more of the underlying art, as well as having consistent width from walls and doors.</li>
</ol>
