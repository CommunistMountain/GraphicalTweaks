# GraphicalTweaks
Mod for the game FTL: Faster Than Light. Changes floor images and map backgrounds.

Change the file extension from .zip to .ftl, or change the setting to consider .zip files as mods.

<ol>
    <li>Floor Image tweak: all vanilla ships now use a more consistent floor image, revealing more of the underlying art, as well as having consistent width from walls and doors.</li>
	<li>Room Alignment fixes: Ships with symmetrical hulls, and rooms that don't match the symmetry, have their rooms shifted:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Kestrel A: 1 down</li>
		<li>Kestrel C: 1 down</li>
		<li>Slug B: 3 up</li>
		<li>Stealth A: 2 up</li>
		<li>Stealth C: 2 up</li>
		<li>Lanius A: 1 up</li>
		<li>Lanius B: 1 up</li>
	</ol>
    <li>Map Background tweak: visual clarity is a problem when beacons appear over bright regions of the default backgrounds, or when Mike Hopley's Enhanced Fleet Pursuit mod shows dark lines over dark regions. This mod replaces the 3 backgrounds with a solid dark grey to solve this. (I made 2 versions of the mod, 1 without this)</li>
